 * This task class can be used in a job containing tasks dynamically
 * created at runtime.  When a task created at runtime has dependency
 * on a task other than the creator task, a pass-through task can be
 * used as the trigger for the runtime task.  The pass-through task
 * needs to be dependent of the creator and dependency tasks.  Otherwise
 * the runtime task may never be triggered due to the reason that the
 * dependency task may complete before the runtime task is created.  In
 * such situation, the notification of completion of dependency task will
 * never reach the runtime task.  With a guard task set up as above, it
 * will ensure the notification will be delivered to runtime tasks
 * depending on it.
